# Cursor Project Rules for AI Agency Website

This `rules.md` file outlines the guidelines and rules for the AI Agency website project. Please adhere to these rules when generating or modifying code within this project using Cursor.

## 1. Technology Stack

- **Framework:**  Utilize **Next.js** (version 15 or later if possible) for the React framework.  Ensure the project structure follows the **Next.js `app` directory structure** for routing and layouts.
- **Language:** Use **TypeScript** for all JavaScript code. Enforce strong typing and leverage TypeScript's features for better code maintainability and readability.
- **Styling:** Employ **Tailwind CSS** for all styling.  Prioritize utility-first styling and ensure consistent application of Tailwind CSS classes throughout the project.
- **Component Library:**  Primarily use **Shadcn UI** components whenever suitable UI elements are required.  If a specific UI element is not available in Shadcn UI, create custom React components styled with Tailwind CSS, aiming for visual consistency with Shadcn UI.

## 2. Component Library Usage - Shadcn UI First

- **Prioritize Shadcn UI:**  For common UI elements (buttons, cards, forms, navigation, etc.), always check if a suitable component exists in the Shadcn UI library first.
- **Custom Components when Necessary:** If a specific UI element is not available in Shadcn UI, create a custom React component. Ensure custom components are styled with Tailwind CSS and maintain visual consistency with the overall Shadcn UI style and the design language of the project.
- **Consistent Shadcn UI Styling:**  When using Shadcn UI components, customize them using Tailwind CSS classes and Shadcn UI's theming and variant options to fit the project's design. Avoid overriding Shadcn UI styles with external CSS unless absolutely necessary.

## 3. Styling and Design Principles

- **Dark Theme:**  The website should have a **predominantly dark theme**, similar to `devtool-magicui.vercel.app`. Use dark background colors and light text colors for optimal contrast and modern aesthetic.
- **Clean and Modern Design:** Aim for a **clean, minimal, and modern design** aesthetic, inspired by `devtool-magicui.vercel.app` and the general style found on websites showcased on `21st.dev`.
- **Typography:** Use **modern sans-serif fonts** for all text elements to ensure readability and a contemporary look. Select fonts that complement the dark theme and overall design.
- **Color Palette:**  Maintain a **limited and cohesive color palette**. Primarily use shades of gray for backgrounds and surfaces, with **accent colors** (e.g., blues, purples, or teals) used sparingly for highlights, interactive elements, and visual interest. Ensure accent colors are used consistently throughout the website.
- **Whitespace and Spacing:**  Utilize **whitespace effectively** to create a clean and uncluttered layout. Pay attention to spacing and padding to ensure elements are well-balanced and visually appealing.
- **Subtle Animations and Transitions:**  Where appropriate, incorporate **subtle animations and transitions** to enhance user experience and add a touch of polish. Use Tailwind CSS's animation and transition utilities or consider lightweight animation libraries if needed.

## 4. Code Style and Best Practices

- **Readability:**  Write **clean, readable, and well-commented code**. Prioritize code clarity and maintainability.
- **Component Modularity:**  Break down the UI into **small, reusable, and well-defined React components**. Follow component-based architecture principles.
- **React Best Practices:** Adhere to React best practices, including proper state management, efficient rendering, and avoiding anti-patterns.
- **TypeScript Best Practices:**  Leverage TypeScript features effectively. Define clear types and interfaces for props and data structures. Minimize the use of `any` type.
- **Tailwind CSS Best Practices:**  Utilize Tailwind CSS utility classes effectively. Avoid writing custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.  Maintain consistency in Tailwind class usage.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms where applicable.

## 5. Naming Conventions

- **Components:** Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `Header`, `ServiceCard`, `ContactForm`).  Place components in appropriate directories (e.g., `components/ui` for Shadcn UI-style components, `components/sections` for page sections).
- **Variables and Functions:** Use camelCase for variables and function names (e.g., `handleButtonClick`, `serviceData`, `isDarkMode`).
- **Types and Interfaces:** Use PascalCase for types and interfaces (e.g., `Service`, `UserData`, `ButtonProps`).

## 6. General Guidance for Cursor

- **Adhere to these rules:** When generating code or making modifications, Cursor should strictly adhere to the rules outlined in this `rules.md` file.
- **Prioritize consistency:** Ensure consistency in technology choices, styling, component usage, and code style throughout the project.
- **Ask for clarification:** If any rule is unclear or if there's a conflict in instructions, Cursor should ask for clarification before proceeding.
- **Focus on Maintainability and Scalability:**  When generating code or suggesting solutions, prioritize maintainability, scalability, and long-term project health.

## 7. Website Functionality and Purpose
