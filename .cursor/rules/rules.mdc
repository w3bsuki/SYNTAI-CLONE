# AI Agency Website - Project Rules

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a professional, engaging, and high-performing website for an AI agency specializing in AI Agents and AI-powered solutions. The website serves as a brand showcase, service platform, and lead generation tool. It must project expertise, trustworthiness, and innovation in the AI field.

## Brand Identity (Further Refinement Needed)

*   **Style:** Modern, clean, and sophisticated, emphasizing technological advancement and trustworthiness.  Similar in aesthetic to `devtool-magicui.vercel.app` and drawing inspiration from sites like `21st.dev`.
*   **Color Palette:** Predominantly dark theme.
    *   `Primary Background: #1A1A1A` (Very Dark Gray) - *Example*
    *   `Secondary Background: #282828` (Slightly Lighter Dark Gray) - *Example*
    *   `Text: #FFFFFF` (White) - *Example*
    *   `Accent: #0A66C2` (Blue - Example, consistent with previous link color) - *Example* - Use sparingly for highlights, CTAs, and interactive elements.
    *   `Hover/Focus: #0F81E0` (Slightly Lighter Blue - Example) - *Example*
    *   [YOU MUST REFINE AND CONFIRM THESE COLORS. Provide hex codes for all key colors.]

    *   [YOU MAY ADJUST THESE, BUT KEEP THEM CONSISTENT]

*   **Image Optimization:** Use `next/image` component. Provide explicit `width` and `height` attributes. Use WebP format. Implement lazy loading.
*   **Accessibility (WCAG):**  Adhere to accessibility guidelines throughout the development process.
*   **Testing:**  Jest and React Testing Library for unit and component tests.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

## Deployment

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

*   **Page Load Speed:**  Target sub-2 second load times.
*   **Lead Generation Rate:** Track contact form submissions and demo requests.
*   **User Engagement:** Monitor time on site, pages per visit, and bounce rate.
